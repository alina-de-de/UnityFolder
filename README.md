Hello Player and welcome to our escape room game. 

First of all, we hope you managed to get out of the room and maybe even beat our record time (0:17).

We decided on creating a escape room, as it is one of our own favorite games to play. 
As this was a completely new approach of coding as compared to the prototype that was introduced by the lecture, 
we found a bunch of useful tutorials and web entries about implementing escape rooms in Unity. 
Most of those created a 2D project, so we decided to do this as well in order to be able to use the additional help we found online. 

First, we created the interactive room (with moving walls, zooming in and changing perspective), second the usable inventory (pickung up and using items) and lastly the overall game process to escape the room (timer, hiding keys).
As the first two steps took a lot more time than we expected and we were only a group of two, we decided on making the overall strategy of the game quite simple. 
We wanted to add more difficult riddles but simply ran out of time. 

Besides the coding part, we also decided on creating our own visual display. 
We drew allmost all images and items ourselves, as we found this creative part of Unity very intriguing and it was also faster to add more visual details at the end. 

Unfortunately, we watched the github tutorial after creating the project and therefore were not able to commit every change of our project into the repository. 
We hope that this is still okay :) 

Thank you very much for the interesting introduction to Unity. 
We really enjoyed creating our own game (altough we had a lot of debugging to do haha).

Note on the uploaded files:
After commiting our project we realized that there are some files which are not neccessary for our "final game" (e.g. Sprites-folder). We weren't quite sure if by deleting some of those our game would lack some resources - so we just decided to leave them in the respective folders. In case there occurs any confusion about which files are neccessary feel free to contact us.
